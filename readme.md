# Game of Life (GPU)

This code repository is suitable for submission for PHYS4004 High Performance
Computing - Assignment 3 - Game of Life (GPU).

Conway's Game of Life is iteratively solved on a grid using CPU, GPU-CUDA, and
GPU-OpenACC codes, using C.

## Contents (for submission)
  - `ex1-gol-cuda/`
  - `ex2-gol-gpu-directives/openacc/`
  - `report/`

A report presenting a brief overview of the repository can be found at
`report/phys4004_assignment_3_gpu.pdf`.

The performance characteristics of the CUDA and OpenACC GPU-codes can be found
at `ex1-gol-cuda/output/performance.nsteps-100.txt` and
`ex2-gol-cuda/openacc/output/performance.nsteps-100.txt` respectively.
